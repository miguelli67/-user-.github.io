    The nucleus is the control center of the cell. It contains the cell’s genetic material (DNA) organized as chromosomes.
    The nucleus directs all cellular activities such as growth, metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell division.
    It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope, which contains pores that regulate what enters and exits the nucleus.
